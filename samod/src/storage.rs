/// The storage abstraction used by a [`Repo`](crate::Repo) to store document data
///
/// This trait is designed to be pretty general. It's effectively a key/value store
/// with range queries. In particular there are no assumptions about the ordering of
/// operations between calls to methods on storage and no assumption of exclusive
/// access to storage.
///
/// I.e. you can have multiple storage instances mutating the same shared storage,
/// `samod` is designed so that this will never lose data.
///
/// ## Storage Keys
///
/// Storage is a key/value store. The keys are effectively `Vec<String>`. This
/// matches things like filesystems, where each element in the `Vec<String>` is
/// a directory and the last item is a file. It can just as well be implemented
/// in other mediums. To make this easier `StorageKey` guarantees that none of
/// the components of the key contain a "/", this means you can use `"/"` to
/// join elements of the key when storing the key as a string.
