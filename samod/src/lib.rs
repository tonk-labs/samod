//! # Samod
//!
//! `samod` is a library for building collaborative applications which work offlne
//! and don't require servers (though servers certainly can be useful). This is
//! achieved by representing data as [`automerge`](https://docs.rs/automerge/latest/automerge/)
//! documents. `samod` is wire compatible with the `automerge-repo` JavaScript library.
//!
//! ## What does all that mean?
//!
//! `samod` helps you manage automerge "documents", which are hierarchical data
//! structures composed of maps, lists, text, and primitive values - a little
//! like JSON. Every change you make to a document is recorded and you can move
//! back and forth through the history of a document - it's a bit like Git for
//! JSON. `samod` takes care of storing changes for you and synchronizing them
//! with connected peers. The interesting part is that given this very detailed
//! history which we never discard, we can merge documents with changes which
//! were made concurrently. This means that we can build applications which
//! allow multiple users to edit the same document without having to have all
//! changes go through a server.
//!
//! ## How it all works
//!
//! The library is structured around a [`Repo`], which talks to a [`Storage`]
//! instance and to which you can connect to other peers using
//! [`Repo::connect`](crate::Repo::connect). Once you have a [`Repo`] you can
//! create documents using [`Repo::create`], or look up existing docuements using
//! [`Repo::find`]. In either case you will get back a [`DocHandle`] which you can
//! use to interact with the document.
//!
//! Typically then, your workflow will look like this:
//!
//! * Initialize a `Repo` at application startup, passing it a
//!   [`RuntimeHandle`](crate::runtime::RuntimeHandle) implementation and
//!   [`Storage`] implementation
//! * Whenever you have connections available (maybe you are connecting to a
//!   sync server, maybe you are receiving peer-to-peer connections) you call
//!   [`Repo::connect`] to drive the connection state.
//! * Create `DocHandle`s using `Repo::create` and look up existing documents
//!   using `Repo::find`
//! * Modify documents using `DocHandle::with_document`
//!
//! Let's walk through each of those steps.
//!
//! ### Initializing a [`Repo`]
//!
//! To initialize a [`Repo`] you call [`Repo::builder()`] to obtain a
//! [`RepoBuilder`] which you use to configure the repo before calling [`RepoBuilder::load()`]
//! to actually load the repository. For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
//! # tokio_test::block_on(async {
//! let repo = samod::Repo::builder(tokio::runtime::Handle::current())
//!     .with_storage(samod::storage::InMemoryStorage::new())
//!     .load()
//!     .await;
//! })
//! ```
//!
//! The first argument to `builder` is an implementation of
//! [`RuntimeHandle`](crate::runtime::RuntimeHandle). Default implementations
//! are provided for `tokio` and `gio` which can be conveniently used via
//! [`Repo::build_tokio`] and [`Repo::build_gio`] respectively. The
//! [`RuntimeHandle`](crate::runtime::RuntimeHandle) trait is straightforward to
//! implement if you want to use some other async runtime.
//!
//! By default `samod` uses an in-memory storage implementation. This is great
//! for prototyping but in most cases you do actually want to persist data somewhere.
//! In this case you'll need an implementation of [`Storage`] to pass to
//! [`RepoBuilder::with_storage`]
//!
//! ### Connecting to peers
//!
//! Once you have a `Repo` you can connect it to peers using [`Repo::connect`].
//! This method returns a future which must be driven to completion to run the
//! connection. Here's an example where we use `futures::channel::mpsc` as the
//! transport. We create two repos and connect them with these channels.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
//! use samod::ConnDirection;
//! use futures::{StreamExt, channel::mpsc};
//! use std::convert::Infallible;
//!
//! tokio_test::block_on(async {
//! let alice = samod::Repo::build_tokio().load().await;
//! let bob = samod::Repo::build_tokio().load().await;
//!
//! // Set up bidirectional channels
//! let (tx_to_bob, rx_from_alice) = mpsc::unbounded();
//! let (tx_to_alice, rx_from_bob) = mpsc::unbounded();
//! // This is just to make the types line up, ignore it
//! let rx_from_alice = rx_from_alice.map(Ok::<_, Infallible>);
//! let rx_from_bob = rx_from_bob.map(Ok::<_, Infallible>);
//!
//! // Run the connection futures
//! tokio::spawn(alice.connect(rx_from_bob, tx_to_bob, ConnDirection::Outgoing));
//! tokio::spawn(bob.connect(rx_from_alice, tx_to_alice, ConnDirection::Incoming));
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! If you are using `tokio` and connecting to something like a TCP socket you
//! can use [`Repo::connect_tokio_io`], which reduces some boilerplate:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
//! # async fn dosomething() {
//! use samod::ConnDirection;
//!
//! let repo: samod::Repo = todo!();
//! let io = tokio::net::TcpStream::connect("sync.automerge.org").await.unwrap();
//! tokio::spawn(repo.connect_tokio_io(io, ConnDirection::Outgoing));
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! If you are connecting to JavaScript sync server using WebSockets you can enable the
//! `tungstenite` feature and use [`Repo::connect_websocket`]. If you are accepting
//! websocket connections in an `axum` server you can use [`Repo::accept_axum`].
//!
//! ### Managing Documents
//!
//! Once you have a [`Repo`] you can use it to manage [`DocHandle`]s. A
//! [`DocHandle`] represents an [`automerge`] document which the [`Repo`]
//! is managing. "managing" here means a few things:
//!
//! * Any changes made to the document using [`DocHandle::with_document`]
//!   will be persisted to storage and synchronized with connected peers
//!   (subject to the [`AnnouncePolicy`]).
//! * Any changes received from connected peers will be applied to the
//!   document and made visible to the application. You can listen for
//!   these changes using [`DocHandle::changes`].
//!
//! To create a new document you use [`Repo::create`] which will return
//! once the document has been persisted to storage. To look up an existing
//! document you use [`Repo::find`]. This will first look in storage, then
//! if the document is not found in storage it will request the document
//! from all connected peers (again subject to the [`AnnouncePolicy`]). If
//! any peer has the document the future returned by [`Repo::find`] will
//! resolve once we have synchronized with at least one remote peer which
//! has the document.
//!
//! You can make changes to a document using [`DocHandle::with_document`].
//!
//! ### Announce Policies
//!
//! By default, `samod` will announce all the [`DocHandle`]s it is synchronizing
//! to all connected peers and will also send requests to any connected peers
//! when you call [`Repo::find`]. This is often not what you want. To customize
//! this logic you pass an implementation of [`AnnouncePolicy`] to
//! [`RepoBuilder::with_announce_policy`]. Note that `AnnouncePolicy` is implemented
//! for `Fn(&DocumentId) -> bool` so you can just pass a closure if you want.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
//! # tokio_test::block_on(async{
//! let authorized_peer = samod::PeerId::from("alice");
//! let repo = samod::Repo::build_tokio().with_announce_policy(move |_doc_id, peer_id| {
//!    // Only announce documents to alice
//!    &peer_id == &authorized_peer
//! }).load().await;
//! # });
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why not just Automerge?
//!
//! `automerge` is a low level library. It provides routines for manipulating
//! documents in memory and an abstract data sync protocol. It does not actually
//! hook this up to any kind of network or storage. Most of the work involved
//! in doing this plumbing is straightforward, but if every application does
//! it themselves, we don't end up with interoperable applications. In particular
//! we don't end up with fungible sync servers. One of the core goals of this
//! library is to allow application authors to be agnostic as to where the
//! user synchronises data by implementing a generic network and storage layer
//! which all applications can use.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Here's a somewhat fully featured example of using `samod` to manage a todo list:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
//! # tokio_test::block_on(async {
//! use automerge::{ReadDoc, transaction::{Transactable as _}};
//! use futures::StreamExt as _;
//!
//! use samod::ConnDirection;
//!
//! use std::convert::Infallible;
//!
//! # let _ = tracing_subscriber::fmt().try_init();
//!
//! let repo = samod::Repo::build_tokio().load().await; // You don't have to use tokio
//!
//! // Create an initial skeleton for our todo list
//! let mut initial_doc = automerge::Automerge::new();
//! initial_doc.transact::<_, _, automerge::AutomergeError>(|tx| {
//!     let todos = tx.put_object(automerge::ROOT, "todos", automerge::ObjType::List)?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }).unwrap();
//!
//! // Now create a `samod::DocHandle` using `Repo::create`
//! let doc_handle_1 = repo.create(initial_doc).await.unwrap();
//!
//! // Now, create second repo, representing some other device
//! let repo2 = samod::Repo::build_tokio().load().await;
//!
//! // Connect the two repos to each other
//! let (tx_to_1, rx_from_2) = futures::channel::mpsc::unbounded();
//! let (tx_to_2, rx_from_1) = futures::channel::mpsc::unbounded();
//! tokio::spawn(repo2.connect(rx_from_1.map(Ok::<_, Infallible>), tx_to_1, ConnDirection::Outgoing));
//! tokio::spawn(repo.connect(rx_from_2.map(Ok::<_, Infallible>), tx_to_2, ConnDirection::Incoming));
//!
//! // Wait for the second repo to be connected to the first repo
//! repo2.when_connected(repo.peer_id()).await.unwrap();
//!
//! // Now fetch the document on repo2
//! let doc2 = repo2.find(doc_handle_1.document_id().clone()).await.unwrap().unwrap();
//!
//! // Create a todo list item in doc2
//! doc2.with_document(|doc| {
//!     doc.transact(|tx| {
//!        let todos = tx.get(automerge::ROOT, "todos").unwrap().
//!           expect("todos should exist").1;
//!        tx.insert(todos, 0, "Buy milk")?;
//!       Ok::<_, automerge::AutomergeError>(())
//!   }).unwrap();
//! });
//!
//! // Wait for the change to be received on repo1
//! doc_handle_1.changes().next().await.unwrap();
//!
//! // See the the document handle on repo1 reflects the change
//! doc_handle_1.with_document(|doc| {
//!   let todos = doc.get(automerge::ROOT, "todos").unwrap().
//!      expect("todos should exist").1;
//!   let item = doc.get(todos, 0).unwrap().expect("item should exist").0;
//!   let automerge::Value::Scalar(val) = item else {
//!     panic!("item should be a scalar");
//!   };
//!   let automerge::ScalarValue::Str(s) = val.as_ref() else {
//!        panic!("item should be a string");
//!   };
//!   assert_eq!(s, "Buy milk");
//!   Ok::<_, automerge::AutomergeError>(())
//! }).unwrap();
//! # });
//! ```

/// The entry point to this library
///
/// A [`Repo`] represents a set of running [`DocHandle`]s, active connections to
/// other peers over which we are synchronizing the active [`DocHandle`]s, and
/// an instance of [`Storage`] where document data is persisted.
///
/// Individual documents require exclusive access to mutate (including receiving
/// sync messages). In order to make this non-blocking the `Repo` spawns a
/// task for each document on an underlying threadpool. All method calls on
/// the `Repo` can consequently be called in asynchronous contexts as they do
/// not block.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// To obtain a [`Repo`] call [`Repo::builder`] (or the various `Repo::build_*`
/// variants specific to different runtimes) to obtain a [`RepoBuilder`] and
/// then call [`RepoBuilder::load`] to actually load the [`Repo`].
///
/// Once you have a repo you can connect new network connections to it using
/// [`Repo::connect`]. You can create new documents using [`Repo::create`] and
/// lookup existing documents using [`Repo::find`].
///
/// When you are finished with a [`Repo`] you can call [`Repo::stop`] to flush
/// everything to storage before shutting down the application.
